# 100DaysofMLCode LOG

### Day 1: August 16, 2018 

**Time spent**: 1 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Made a public pledge to code/study machine learning for 3 hours every day (on average) for the next 100 days
2. Set up my Twitter account
3. Created this public log for the challenge 
4. Enrolled to the Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization Course by coursera.org

### Day 2: August 17, 2018 

**Time spent**: 3 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Completed Week 1 of the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course" by deeplearning.ai
  -learned major terms and theoretical concepts of deep learning
  -understand differences between CNNs and RNNs and their major use cases 
2. Started Week 2: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
  -use cases, implementation, sigmoid function and some math behind it

### Day 3: August 18, 2018 

failed

### Day 4: August 19, 2018 

**Time spent**: 3 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. learned about logistic regression, cost function, gradient descent, derivatives 
2. started to build a logistic regression classifier in Python

### Day 5: August 20, 2018 

**Time spent**: 3 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Installed git, learned & executed basic commands
2. Learned how to:
  compute derivatives for a gradient descent with a computational graph
  implement gradient descent for logistic regression 
  use vectorization and why is it so important for Deep Learning 
5. Implemented vectorization using numpy
