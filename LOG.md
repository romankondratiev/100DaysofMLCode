# 100DaysofMLCode LOG

### Day 1: August 16, 2018 

**Time spent**: 1.2 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Made a public pledge to code/study machine learning for 3 hours every day (on average) for the next 100 days
2. Set up my Twitter account
3. Created this public log for the challenge 
4. Enrolled to the Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization Course by coursera.org

**Thoughts**:
Hopefully I'll start learning tomorrow


### Day 2: August 17, 2018 

**Time spent**: 3 hrs  

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Completed Week 1 of the "Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course" by deeplearning.ai
  -learned major terms and theoretical concepts of deep learning
  -understand differences between CNNs and RNNs and their major use cases 
2. Started Week 2: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network
  -use cases, implementation, sigmoid function and some math behind it

**Thoughts**:
Interesting but I want to start coding
